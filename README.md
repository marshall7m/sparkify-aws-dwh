# Project: AWS Data Warehouse
## Introduction Scenario
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

# Project Description
In this project, I applied what I've learned about data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. I loaded data from S3 to stage tables on Redshift and executed SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

# Project Datasets
Two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

## Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

# Schema for Song Play Analysis

## Primary Key Explanation

- songplay: sonplay_id is the primary key because it uniquely indentifies each observation within the songplay table
- users: user_id is the sonplay foreign key that connects the songplay and users tables together
- songs: song_id is the sonplay foreign key that connects the songplay and songs tables together
- artists: artist_id is the sonplay foreign key that connects the songplay and artists tables together
- time:  start_time is the sonplay foreign key that connects the songplay and start_time tables together

## Distribution Style Explanation

- users: Distribution all is used since there is a small user base of 105. This elimates the need for shuffling between nodes for sql joins since the users dimension table is copied on each node. If Sparkify's user base increases exponentially then it may better to use a distribution key that will be used for group by queries by the analytics team (e.g. distributing by level or gender).
- songs: The artist_id column is the distribution key so that songs by the same artist will be distributed on the same node. This will reduce the need for shuffling between nodes for sql joins. 
- artists: The location column is the distribution key because the analytics team may want to sort the artist by location in relation to the user's location. 
- time: The start_time column is the sort key because the analytics team may filter results by a specific time range.

# Project Files

- redshift_notebook.ipynb: Initiates RedShift cluster/role and validate etl pipeline
- create_table.py: Creates fact and dimension tables for star schema in Redshift
- etl.py: Loads data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and processes data into analytics tables on Redshift
- sql_queries.py: SQL statements used in the two files above.
